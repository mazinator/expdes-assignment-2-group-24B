comments
1. code for train&predict available, looks solid
2. missing hardware requirements?
3. package version given, but not for subpackages/subdependencies needed for these packages (e.g., Rust)
4. python version not stated, picked 3.7.5rc1 which was released around 6 months before paper was published

#suggestion for splitting work:
daniel: continue to reproduce results
1 person: start with final report (Introduction and so on)
2 persons: work through "Exercise 2" Appendix (see below)





APPENDIX:

5. Specific hardware and softwaresetup necessary

B. Data
1. Data not provided
2. Data partially not provided 
3. Meta data not provided

C. Process
1. Comparison metrics or baselines not discussed 
2. Experimental setup not described
3. Experiment workflow incomplete
4. Inconsistencies inpaper, code and data
5. Results differ significantly
