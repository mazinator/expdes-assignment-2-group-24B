comments
1. code for train&predict available, looks solid
2. missing hardware requirements?
3. package version given, but not for subpackages/subdependencies needed for these packages (e.g., Rust)
4. python version not stated, picked 3.7.5rc1 which was released around 6 months before paper was published

===========================================================

#suggestion for splitting work:
daniel: continue to reproduce results
1 person: start with final report (Introduction and so on)
2 persons: work through "Exercise 2" Appendix (see below)





APPENDIX:
A. Code/Setup Difficulties 
1. Code not provided 
        -> code is provided
2. Code partially not provided 
        -> code is provided
3. Faulty code provided -> 
        -> preprocessing (because of wrong splitting of pandas added to the code)
        -> index column removed of queries_gender_annotated.csv
        -> wordlist_genderspecific.txt has apparently changed, as it is referenced as "gender_specific_wordlist.csv"
4. Information about software versions missing 
        -> software version (of the libraries) provided, but not the python version
5. Specific hardware and softwaresetup necessary 
        -> not mentioned. but virtual environment has been set up to handle lower python version

B. Data
1. Data not provided 
        -> data not provided in the repository, but under other repository: https://github.com/navid-rekabsaz/GenderBias_IR/blob/master/resources
2. Data partially not provided 
        -> data not provided in the repository
3. Meta data not provided

C. Process
1. Comparison metrics or baselines not discussed
        -> metrics table (accuracy, F1 score) provided but not stated explicitly in the paper
        -> lacks statistical metrics, could be important but not sure it fits this paper
        -> rest of baselines well discussed 
2. Experimental setup not described
        -> experimental setup described
3. Experiment workflow incomplete
4. Inconsistencies inpaper, code and data
5. Results differ significantly
